via: <http://dinersjournal.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/29/the-minimalist-pasta-with-anchovies-and-arugula/>

**Yield:** 4 servings  
**Time:** 30 minutes

## Ingredients

* Salt
* 4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
* 4 large cloves garlic, peeled and slivered
* 8 anchovy fillets, or more to taste, with some of their oil
* 1/2 teaspoon or more crushed red pepper flakes
* 6 cups arugula
* 1/2 pound linguine or other long pasta
* Freshly ground black pepper

## Method

1. Bring a large pot of water to boil and salt it.
2. Put the oil in a deep skillet, and turn heat to medium. A minute later, add the garlic, and then the anchovies and red pepper flakes. When the garlic sizzles and the anchovies break up, turn the heat to its lowest setting.
3. Cook the pasta until it is tender but not mushy. Reserve 1 cup cooking liquid, and drain. Add pasta to skillet, along with enough reserved cooking water to make a sauce. Off the heat, combine the pasta with the greens. Add salt and pepper to taste. Toss, taste and adjust the seasoning and serve.
